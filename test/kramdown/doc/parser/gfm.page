# GFM Parser

## Introduction

This parser was built-in until kramdown 2.0 and since then is available through the
[`kramdown-parser-gfm` gem][parser-gfm].

It can parse ["Github Flavored
Markdown"](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). This is a format of Markdown
that is used on Github.com for most places where textual input is required, such as issues and
comments. Some of the extensions, notably the "backtick fenced code blocks" are also used on other
sites, for example StackOverflow.

See <https://github.com/kramdown/parser-gfm> for documentation!
