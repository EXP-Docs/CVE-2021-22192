## kramdown 1.12.0 released

This release features two enhancements for definition lists:

1. IALs can now  be applied to definition terms:

       {:.classy} term
       : and its definition

2. IDs for definition terms can now be created automatically (similar to header IDs) and optionally
   assigned a prefix:

       {:auto_ids}
       term1
       : definition

       term2
       : definition

       ^

       {:auto_ids-prefix}
       term1
       : definition

       term2
       : definition

Furthermore, compatibility of the GFM parser has been improved in regards to
list/blockquotes/codeblocks that are used directly after a paragraph (i.e. without a blank line).


## Changes

* 4 minor change:

  - Allow using an IAL for definition terms (`<dt>`) as is already possible with definitions
    themselves (`<dd>`)
  - Added automatic generation of IDs (with optional prefix) for terms of definition lists (fixes
    [#355], requested by Greg Wilson)
  - Removed obfuscation for e-mail links (fixes [#343], requested by Anton Tsyganenko)
  - New option 'gfm_quirks' for enabling/disabling parsing differences of the GFM parser with
    respect to the kramdown parser

* 4 bug fixes:

  - Added support for HTML5 element `<main>` (fixes [#334], reported by Jean-Michel Lacroix)
  - Fixed math element output for HTML converter when no math engine is set (fixes [#342], reported
    by Adrian Sampson)
  - Fixed problem when using custom HTML formatter for syntax highlighter rouge (fixes [#356], patch
    by Alexey Vasiliev)
  - Better compatibility with GFM when lists/blockquotes/codeblocks are used directly after a
    paragraph (fixes [#336] (reported by Shuanglei Tao), [#359] (reported by Matti Schneider) via
    the patch [#358] by Shuanglei Tao)

* 3 other fixes and enhancements:

  - Added some more examples for how list indentation works (fixes [#353], requested by Robbert
    Brak)
  - Using `RbConfig` instead of deprecated `Config` for determining data directory (fixes [#345],
    patch by CÃ©dric Boutillier)
  - JRuby is now also tested via TravisCI (fixes [#363], patch by Shuanglei Tao)
