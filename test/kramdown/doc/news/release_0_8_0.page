## kramdown 0.8.0 released

One of the bigger changes in this release is the support for converting HTML tags into native
kramdown elements via the new `html_to_native` option. For example, the HTML tag `p` is converted to
the native paragraph element instead of a generic HTML tag if this option is set to `true`. This is
especially useful for converters that don't handle generic HTML tags (e.g. the LaTeX converter).

This conversion is a feature of the new standalone HTML parser which is used by the kramdown parser
for parsing HTML tags.

Also note that support for the old extension syntax and custom extensions has been dropped as of
this release! And the `filter_html` option will be removed in the next release because there exist
better facilities for performing this kind of task!


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - New parser for parsing HTML documents
  - Added the option `html_to_native` (default: `false`) which tells the kramdown parser whether to
    convert HTML tags to native kramdown elements or to generic HTML elements.

* Minor changes:

  - Table header cells are now represented by their own element type
  - The element type `:html_text` is not used anymore - it is replaced by the general `:text`
    element
  - HTML comments are now converted to LaTeX comments when using the LaTeX converter
  - The LaTeX converter can now output the contents of HTML `<i>` and `<b>` tags

* Bug fixes:

  - Attributes that have been assigned to the to-be-replaced TOC list are now added correctly on the
    generated TOC list in the HTML converter
  - Fixed problem in typographic symbol processing where an entity string instead of an entity
    element was added
  - Fixed problem with HTML span parsing: some text was not added to the correct element when the
    end tag was not found
  - HTML `code` and `pre` tags are now parsed as raw HTML tags
  - HTML tags inside raw HTML span tags are now parsed correctly as raw HTML tags
  - The Rakefile can now be used even if the `rdoc` gem is missing (patch by Ben Armston)
  - Fixed generation of footnotes in the LaTeX converter (patch by Ben Armston)
  - Fixed LaTeX converter to support code spans/blocks in footnotes
  - HTML comments and XML processing instructions are now correctly parsed inside raw HTML tags
  - HTML script tags are now correctly parsed
  - Fixed the abbreviation conversion in the LaTeX converter
  - Empty image links are not output anymore by the LaTeX converter

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension syntax and support for custom extensions has been removed.
  - The `filter_html` option will be removed in the next release.
