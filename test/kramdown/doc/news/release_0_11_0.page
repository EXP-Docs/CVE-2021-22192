## kramdown 0.11.0 released

The biggest change in this release is the implementation of the "lazy syntax" which allows one to
not use the correct indent or block marker and still continue a paragraph, blockquote, ... The
original Markdown syntax allows this and it was requested that kramdown allows this, too. However,
the main reason for adding this syntax to kramdown is not to encourage authors to be lazy but to
allow kramdown texts to be hard-wrapped by other applications (think, for example, email programs).
Therefore you shouldn't make active use of this feature when creating a kramdown document!

Another important, though minor, change is that invalid HTML tags and extensions are not removed
anymore. This is done because of the general rule that unrecognized elements are treated as simple
text.

**Note**: The "internal" API (which is currently everything except the `Kramdown::Document` class)
has changed and developers may therefore need to update their extensions!
