## kramdown 1.5.0 released

This release brings the addition of [Rouge] as supported syntax highlighting engine besides Coderay
as well as support for MathML output in the HTML converter through the libraries [Ritex] or
[itex2MML] as alternatives to MathJax.

By restructuring the code it will now be very easy to add other syntax highlighters or math engines
in the future.

Please also note that the old 'coderay\_\*' options are still supported but they are *deprecated* as
of now. It is recommended to use the new ['syntax_highlighter'] and ['syntax_highlighter_opts']
options instead. The latter also take precedence over the former 'coderay_\*' options.


## Changes

* 6 minor changes:

  - Syntax highlighters are now configurable via the new ['syntax_highlighter'] option.
  - [Rouge] has been added as alternative to Coderay for syntax highlighting (requested originally
    as Pgyments support in [#24] by Jonathan Martin and then [#68] by Eric Mill and [#141] by
    Jeanine Adkisson).
  - The `<div>` tag surrounding syntax highlighted code now gets a class `highlighter-NAME`
    attached where NAME is the syntax highlighter used (requested in [#76] by Marvin GÃ¼lker)
  - Math engines are now configurable via the new ['math_engine'] option.
  - A math engine based on [Ritex] for MathML output has been added (requested by Tom Thorogood who
    provided the initial pull request [#169]).
  - A math engine based on [itex2MML] for MathML output has been added (requested by Tom Thorogood)

* 2 bug fixes:

  - Fixed [#171]: Hard line wrapping in the GFM parser didn't work correctly when an inline element
    started a new line (reported by Zach Ahn)
  - Fixed [#173]: The HTML `<button>` element is now recognized as span-level element (pull request
    by Morandat)
