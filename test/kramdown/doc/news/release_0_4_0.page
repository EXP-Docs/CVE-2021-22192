## kramdown 0.4.0 released

This release features the addition of a [simple table syntax][1] and [syntax highlighting][2] of
code blocks. I think that with these two additions kramdown now supports all the major features
regarding parsing and HTML output that Maruku supports.

Regarding speed: Simple benchmarks using the Markdown README file (can be found inside [this zip
file][3]) show that kramdown is currently faster than, for example, the original Markdown.pl, PHP
Markdown, PHP Markdown Extra, Python Markdown and Maruku.


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added [syntax][1] for simple tables
  - Added optional [syntax highlighting][2] of code blocks through the CodeRay library

* Minor changes:

  - Changed CSS class name `kramdown-footnotes` to `footnotes` for better compatibility

* Bug fixes:

  - Regular expression for matching escaped characters now works correctly
