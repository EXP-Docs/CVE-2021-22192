## kramdown 0.13.1 released

The focus of this release was bringing kramdown one step closer to the 1.0 release. The API hasn't
changed so this is a drop-in replacement for the previous version of kramdown.

If you think that

* kramdown is still missing an important syntax found in another Markdown implementation,
* the API doesn't feel right,
* or anything else is missing or should be changed for the 1.0 release,

please tell us so by writing to <mailto:kramdown-users@rubyforge.org>!

## Changes

* 3 minor changs:

  - The LaTeX converter now inserts `\hypertarget` commands for all elements that have an ID set.
    The normal link syntax can be used to link to such targets (requested by David Doolin)
  - New option `smart_quotes` for specifying how smart quotes should be output (requested by Michael
    Franzl)
  - Any character except a closing bracket is now valid as link identifier (this makes this part of
    the kramdown syntax compatible to Markdown syntax)

* 10 bug fixes:

  - Fixed error when parsing unknown named entities (reported by David Doolin)
  - Added entity definitions for entities `&ensp;`, `&emsp;` and `&thinsp;` (patch by Damien Pollet)
  - Block HTML line was incorrectly recognized as table line (reported by Piotr Szotkowski)
  - Fixed bug RF#28809: Empty `<a>` tags are were output as self-closed tags (reported by Tim
    Cuthbertson)
  - Fixed bug RF#28785: Name of default template in documentation for `template` option was false
    (reported by Matthew Bennink)
  - Fixed bug RF#28769: span extension in list item wrongly triggered list item IAL parser (reported
    by Yann Esposito)
  - The table row parser has been fixed so that it does not use pipes which appear in `<code>` tags
    as cell separators anymore (like it is done with the native code span syntax)
  - Fixed bug where converting `<em>` and `<strong>` tags to native elements was wrongly done
  - Fixed calculation of cell alignment values when converting HTML tables to native ones, `<col/>`
    tags are now correctly used
  - HTML Tables are now only converted to native tables if all table rows have the same number of
    columns.

* 1 deprecation note:

  - Removed deprecated option `toc_depth` -- use the option `toc_levels` instead.
