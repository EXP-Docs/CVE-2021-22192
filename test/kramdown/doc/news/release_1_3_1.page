## kramdown 1.3.1 released

This release mitigates a performance problem introduced due to the storing of the location
information. On Rubies prior to 2.0 the performance impact was negligible but on Ruby 2.0 and 2.1
performance was much worse.

With the fix the performance is not on prior levels but much better. See the [tests
page](../tests.html) which has been updated with current performance graphs.

Also note that for PDF support you now need the newer Prawn versions (i.e. 0.13.x instead of
1.0.0.rc*)!
