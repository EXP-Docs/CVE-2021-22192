## kramdown 1.7.0 released

This release brings among other things support for the 'minted' syntax highlighter for LaTeX and a
new math engine based on MathJax-Node that outputs to MathML.


## Changes

* 4 minor changes:

  - The syntax highlighter ['minted'](../syntax_highlighter/minted.html) for the [LaTeX
    converter](../converter/latex.html) is now available (fixes issue [#93], initial patch [#242] by
    l3kn)
  - A new [math engine based on MathJax-Node](../math_engine/mathjaxnode.html) that outputs to
    MathML is now available (patch [#240] by Tom Thorogood)
  - Fixed [#244], [#246]: Fenced code blocks now allow a dash in the code language name (requested
    and patched by Dennis GÃ¼nnewig)
  - The option list in the man page as well in the output of `kramdown --help` is now sorted.

* 2 bug fixes:

  - Fixed [#230]: Warning message for method in `lib/kramdown/utils/configurable.rb` will not show
    anymore (reported by Robert A. Heiler)
  - Fixed [#239]: Handling of single/double quotes in reference style links now follows the same
    rules as with inline links (reported by Josh Davis)
