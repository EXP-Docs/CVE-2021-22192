## kramdown 1.8.0 released

This release contains only some minor updates and bug fixes.


## Changes

* 4 minor changes:

  - The LaTeX converter now uses `\texttt` instead of `\tt` for code spans (fixes [#257], reported
    by richard101696)
  - New option `footnote_backlink` for changing the backlink of footnotes in the HTML converter
    (fixes [#247], requested by Benjamin Esham)
  - A quote directly followed by an ellipsis is now converted into an opening quotation mark (fixes
    [#253], requested by Michael Franzl)
  - Removed warning for self-closing HTML elements that are not self-closed (fixes [#262], requested
    by Gregory Pakosz)

* 3 bug fixes:

  - Fixed [#251]: The special character sequence `` \` `` now works correctly when used in footnotes
    or headers that appear in the table of contents (reported by Peter Kehl)
  - Fixed [#254]: kramdown crashed on encountering a table with multiple consecutive separator lines
    (reported by Christian Kruse)
  - Fixed [#256]: Certain footnote definitions and codeblocks lead to crashes or unneeded
    backtracking in the regular expression engine - fixed by using atomic grouping (reported by Ali
    Ok)
