## kramdown 0.2.0 released

The most important changes in this release are the inclusion of a definition list syntax and the
much improved HTML parser. For example, the HTML parser now recognizes the `markdown` attribute for
enabling and disabling syntax processing in an HTML element and it works in many more scenarios.

The kramdown syntax is still a bit in in a state of flux but all of the major syntax elements
(except a syntax for tables) are now available. The following releases will focus on stability and
fixing bugs.

kramdown now also passes 16 from the 23 original Markdown test cases and if one looks at the ones
that fail one can easily see that this is because of the small changes in the syntax (e.g.
converting `---` to `&mdash`). This means that almost all Markdown documents show be correctly
parsed by kramdown!

Last but not least I want to thank Eric Sunshine for his many helpful comments, suggestions and bug
reports!


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Definition lists are now supported
  - Option `auto_ids` now defaults to `true`
  - kramdown syntax (except HTML block lines) is not processed anymore by default in HTML block tags
  - Added option for enabling/disabling parsing of HTML blocks/spans
  - Added recognition and usage of the "markdown" attribute for HTML block/span tags
  - Renamed extensions `kdoptions` to `options` and `nokramdown` to `nomarkdown` (suggested by Eric
    Sunshine)
  - Added support for setting header IDs via the syntax available in PHP Markdown Extra and Maruku

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed bug that occured when using `auto_ids=true` and an IAL for assigning an ID to a header
  - Fixed bug with parsing of autolinks (reported by Eric Sunshine)
  - Fixed many bugs regarding HTML parsing -- HTML parsing should work much better now (reported by
    Eric Sunshine)
  - Fixed bug with parsing of horizontal rules which contain tabs

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension names `kdoptions` and `nokramdown` will be removed in one of the next
    versions, use the new names `options` and `nomarkdown`.
