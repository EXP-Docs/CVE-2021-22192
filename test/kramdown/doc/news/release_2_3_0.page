## kramdown 2.3.0 released

Although this is a minor version bump there is **one breaking change**: Parsing of XML processing
instructions was removed because they are invalid for HTML5 documents.

This change should only affect a negligible amount of existing kramdown documents since XML
processing instructions were never something a normal user would use.

Additionally, CVE-2020-14001 is addressed to avoid problems when using the `{::options /}` extension
together with the 'template' option. **This means updating is highly recommended!**

## Changes

* 2 major changes:

  - New option 'forbidden_inline_options' to restrict the options allowed with the `{::options /}`
    extension. This also addresses the security issue described in [CVE-2020-14001].
  - Parsing of XML processing instructions is not done anymore for kramdown documents because they
    are invalid for HTML5 (fixes issue [#660] by Samuel Williams)

* 1 minor change:

  - Several internal changes with respect to memory usage and performance (PRs [#654], [#655],
    [#665] by Ashwin Maroli)

* 2 bug fixes:

  - Extend allowed characters in IDs set with headers to all characters allowed by XML (fixes [#658]
    by Samuel Williams)
  - Fix thread safety issue by moving global state into an instance variable (fixes [#663]
    by Samuel Williams)

* 1 other change:

  - Documentation fixes and updates (issue [#662] by Samuel Williams, PR [#656] by Noah Doersing)
