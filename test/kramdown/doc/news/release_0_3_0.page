## kramdown 0.3.0 released

The HTML block syntax was changed in this release sothat using raw HTML blocks works more naturally
and the rules are easier to remember. This also lead to the creation of a completely new HTML block
parser. Apart from that, there have also been some bug fixes.

Another important change is that kramdown now also runs under Ruby 1.8.5.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added a compatibility fix so that kramdown works under Ruby 1.8.5 (requested by Steve Huff)
  - Complete overhaul of the used block HTML syntax and block HTML parser
  - Using the same semantics for invalid end tags and unclosed tags in the block and span HTML
    parser

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed warnings on Ruby 1.9
  - Fixed bug in emphasis parser where emphasis started with an underscore at the beginning of a new
    line inside a paragraph was not recognized (reported by Eric Sunshine)

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension names `kdoptions` and `nokramdown` have been removed, only the new names
    `options` and `nomarkdown` will work from now on.
