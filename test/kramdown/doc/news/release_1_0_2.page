## kramdown 1.0.2 released

This release fixes some bugs; updating is recommended.

Some notes:

* The [tests page](../tests.html) has been updated to include relative times in the benchmark so
  that it is possible to better gauge the performance of kramdown (requested by postmodern).

* The [kramdown Wiki][1] now contains a listing of libraries that extend kramdown (idea by
  postmodern).


## Changes

* 4 bug fixes

  - Fixed [GH#51]: Try requiring a parser/converter library based on the specified input/output name
    (requested by postmodern)
  - Fixed [GH#49]: Convert non-breaking space to `~` for LaTeX converter (patch by Henning Perl)
  - Fixed [GH#42]: No more warning for IALs/ALDs/extensions without attributes (reported by DHB)
  - Fixed [GH#44]: Removed trailing whitespace in link definition for kramdown converter (patch by
    Marcus Stollsteimer)
