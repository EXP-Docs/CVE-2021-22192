## kramdown 1.3.0 released

This release brings a pure Ruby PDF converter for kramdown based on the Prawn library. The PDF
output can be customized by sub-classing the converter or by using a template file that adjusts the
converter object.


## Changes

* 1 major change:

  - A pure Ruby PDF converter based on Prawn is now available

* 7 minor changes:

  - New option 'auto_id_stripping' can be used to strip HTML and other formatting before converting
    a header text to an ID (fixed [GH#90] requested by Tuckie)
  - New option 'hard_wrap' for configuring the line break behaviour of the GFM parser ([GH#83],
    patch by Brandur)
  - Location information (only line numbers) are now available in the :location option on most
    kramdown elements ([GH#96] patch by Jo Hund)
  - Minitest 5.x is now used for testing.
  - A converter class can now specify whether a template should be applied before, after or before
    and after the conversion.
  - If a file specified with the "template" option is not found and the option starts with
    "string://", the rest is assumed to be the template.
  - Unknown option keys are now passed through and not removed anymore

* 5 bug fixes:

  - Fixed [GH#77]: Line break inside inline math statement now works correctly (reported by
    memeplex)
  - Fixed problem with line breaks in GFM parser
  - Fixed [GH#95]: Option coderay_bold_every now also accepts the value false (reported by Simon van
    der Veldt)
  - Fixed [GH#91]: Template extension is now the same as the converter name (initial patch by
    Andreas Josephson)
  - Fixed output of consecutive em/strong elements in kramdown converter

* 3 documentation fixes:

  - The kramdown website is now hosted at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org> - please update your
    bookmarks!
  - Fixed [GH#80]: Typo in README.md (patch by Luca Barbato)
  - Fixed [GH#81]: Typo in options documentation (patch by Pete Michaud)

* Deprecation notes:

  - Using `.convertername` instead of `.converter_name` is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0
  - The option 'auto_id_stripping' will be removed in 2.0 because it will be the default.
