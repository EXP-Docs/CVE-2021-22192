## kramdown 0.10.0 released

This release contains many small changes and improvements as well as many bug fixes, thanks to all
the people on the kramdown mailing list!


## Changes

* Minor changes:

  - The LaTeX converter now also outputs the element attributes on the end tag (requested by Michael
    Franzl)
  - New option `entity_output` for specifying how entities should be output
  - The underscore in the option names is now replaced with a hyphen for nicer CLI option names
  - Paragraphs that contain only an image are converted to figures in the LaTeX converter (requested
    by Michael Franzl)
  - Added information to the LaTeX converter documentation on how to change the header types and
    quotation marks

* Bug fixes:

  - LaTeX converter now outputs line breaks correctly (reported by Michael Franzl)
  - Always outputting the entities `zcaron` and `Zcaron` numerically since browser support seems to
    be non-existing (reported by Eric Sunshine)
  - Fixed warnings and problems when running under Ruby 1.9.2-rc1
  - Fixed problem with smart quote directly after smart quote output in LaTeX converter (reported by
    Michael Franzl)
  - Fixed problem in the HTML parser that prevented `<body markdown="1">` from being processed
    correctly (reported by Eric Sunshine)
  - Blockquotes with multiple child elements are now output with the `quotation` environment instead
    of the `quote` environment by the LaTeX converter (reported by Michael Franzl)
  - Fixed problem with parsing autolinks when using an encoding different from UTF-8 (reported by
    Eric Sunshine)
  - Fixed problem with parsing HTML `<a>` tag without `href` attribute (reported by Eric Sunshine)

* Deprecation notes:

  - The option `numeric_entities` is replaced by the new option `entity_output` and will be removed
    in the next version
  - The method `Kramdown::Converter::Html#options_for_element` has been removed
