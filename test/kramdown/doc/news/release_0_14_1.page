## kramdown 0.14.1 released

This is just a bug fix release and it is recommened to update to this version.

## Changes

* 3 bug fixes

  - Only HTML elements that must not contain a body (like `<br />`) are output in this form, all
    other elements now use an explicit closing tag (resolves among other things issues with `<i>`)
  - Specifying a block IAL before a definition list now works correctly
  - Fixed bug [GH#30]: Empty body for a definition in a definition list lead to an exception
    (reported by Mark Johnson)

[GH#30]: https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/30
