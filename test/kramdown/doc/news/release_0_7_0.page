## kramdown 0.7.0 released

This release adds syntax support for abbreviations. This means that kramdown is now syntax-wise on
par with Maruku and PHP Markdown Extra!

Another big change is the extension support: After some discussion on the mailing list (many thanks
to Eric Sunshine and Shawn Van Ittersum), the syntax for the extensions has been changed and support
for custom extensions will be dropped in a future release.

Additionally, the option `auto_ids` has been moved from being interpreted by the parser to being
interpreted by the converters. This means that it is not possible anymore to turn automatic header
ID generation on or off for parts of a text.

The HTML and LaTeX converters also gained the ability to generate a table of contents. Just add the
reference name "toc" to an ordered or unordered list and it will be replaced by the ToC (this is
"coincidentally" the same syntax that Maruku uses...).


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added support for PHP Markdown Extra like abbreviations
  - Added support for span extensions
  - New syntax for block/span extensions
  - Added support for generating a table of contents in the HTML and LaTeX converters

* Minor changes:

  - The option `auto_ids` has been moved from the parser to the converters.
  - Invalid span IALs are now removed from the output
  - IALs can now be applied to individual list items by placing the IAL directly after the list item
    marker
  - Added an option for prefixing automatically generated IDs with a string
  - Block IALs can now also be put before a block element

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a problem with parsing smart quotes at the beginning of a line (reported by Michael
    Franzl)

* Deprecation notes:

  - Removed deprecated CLI option `-f`
  - The old extension syntax and support for custom extensions will be removed in the next release.
