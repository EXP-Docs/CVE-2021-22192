## kramdown 1.6.0 released

This release contains many fixes and minor enhancements as well as one major goodie that comes with
a small caveat: block IALs can now be applied to link and abbreviation definitions!

It may not sound like much but allowing block IALs to be applied to link definitions alleviates the
problem that additional attributes could only be specified via span IALs. Now such attributes can be
stored together with the URL and title at the link definition, for example:

    This is a ![resized image].

    [resized image]: some_image.jpg "with a title"
    {: height="36px" width="36px" style="border: 1px solid green"}

There is one **small caveat**, though. Regard the following construct:

    [linkdef]: http://example.com
    {:.block-ial}
    block element, e.g. a paragraph

The block IAL would have been applied to the paragraph in previous versions but now it is applied to
the link definition. However, such a construct is not very likely encountered in the real world.


## Changes

* 7 minor changes:

  - Block IALs can now be applied to link and abbreviation definitions (inspired by issue [#194]
    from cabo)
  - The syntax highlighting engine for Rouge now allows custom formatter classes to be used (issue
    [#214], requested by BackOrder)
  - The MathJax math engine now allows adding previews (issue [#225], requested by jethrogb)
  - The "toc_levels" option can now also take a Range object (pull request [#210] by Jens Kr√§mer)
  - The generated table of contents of the HTML converter now contains ID attributes on the links so
    that back-references can be used (issue [#195], requested by Ciro Santilli)
  - A warning is now generated when duplicate HTML attributes are detected (issue [#201], requested
    by winniehell)
  - Updated used version of prawn to 2.0.0

* 8 bug fixes:

  - Fixed [#192]: Emphasis by using underscore sometimes wrongly worked within a word (reported by
    Michael Franzl)
  - Fixed [#198]: Empty alt attributes on `<img>` tags are now correctly handled by the kramdown
    converter (reported by winniehell)
  - Fixed [#200]: Trailing whitespace is now really removed in paragraphs (reported by winniehell)
  - Fixed [#220]: HTML blocks with attributes weren't correctly detected when directly after another
    block (reported by Bill Tozier)
  - Fixed [#199]: Empty title attributes are now ignored for images when using the kramdown
    converter (reported by and pull request [#206] from winniehell)
  - Leading and trailing white space from math statements is now stripped as the whitespace
    sometimes lead to LaTeX conversion errors
  - Fixed [#226]: Class names may now start with a dash in IALs/ALDs (reported by Adam Hardwick)
  - Multiple consecutive block IALs before an element are now correctly processed
