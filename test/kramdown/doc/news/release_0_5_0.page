## kramdown 0.5.0 released

This release features syntax support for smart quotes in kramdown documents and a new converter for
LaTeX output. The kramdown binary has also been enhanced to support setting any option.

The additional support for the smart quotes makes this release of kramdown a little bit slower than
the previous releases when run under Ruby 1.8. However, a small optimization in the span parser
which is not noticable under Ruby 1.8 gives quite a performance boost under Ruby 1.9 (see the graphs
on the [tests page](../tests.html)).

Also note that the internals have been restructured slightly. So if you do more than just using the
basic

    Kramdown::Document.new(SOURCE, OPTIONS).to_html
{: .language-ruby}

you may need to adapt your code.

Since the option handling has been revamped, each coderay option must not be set separably!

## Changes
