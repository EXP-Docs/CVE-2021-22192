## kramdown 0.14.0 released

First of all please note that this release contains a **backwards-incompatible** change: The syntax
for specifying a code language for a code block or code span has changed. Instead of using
`lang='CODELANG'` one has to use `.language-CODELANG` now.

This change has been introduced to avoid problems because the `lang="..."` attribute is used by HTML
for other purposes than setting the code language. Furthermore using `.language-CODELANG` is also
proposed by HTML5 and it seems to be a good way to achieve the needed functionality.

Other changes in this release include the possibility of setting the code language on the starting
line of a fenced code block and a way of excluding certain headers from the table of contents by
assigning the `.no_toc` class to them.

## Changes

* 2 major changes

  - Code language is now specified via `.language-CODELANG` instead of `lang='CODELANG'`
  - Implemented support for setting language on fenced code block starting line (initial patch by
    Bran)

* 1 minor change

  - Headers with an ID can be prevented from showing in the TOC by assigning the `.no_toc` class to
    them (patch by Tim Bates)

* 1 bug fix

  - Numeric instead of symbolic HTML entities are now the default fallback (patch by Gioele
    Barabucci)
