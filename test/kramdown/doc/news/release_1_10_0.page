## kramdown 1.10.0 released

This release brings the usual bug fixes but also support for the strikethrough syntax in the GFM
parser as well as some enhancements regarding the specification of language names for syntax
highlighting purposes.


## Changes

* 4 minor changes:

  - Support for the math-engine MathJax-Node was updated to use the new mathjax-node package (fixes
    [#313], pull request by Tom Thorogood)
  - URL query parameters can now be appended to language names specified in fenced code blocks if
    the syntax highlighting engine accepts them (fixes [#234])
  - Added strikethrough syntax to the GFM parser (fixes [#184] and [#307]; initial pull request by
    Diego Galeota, updated by Parker Moore)
  - Allow almost all characters in class names that are defined via a special syntax (fixes [#318],
    requested by cabo)

* 4 bug fixes:

  - Fixed a problem where `Kramdown::Document.new` would only accept the symbol :input but not the
    string 'input' as valid key (fixes [#312], pull request by Sun Yaozhu)
  - Fixed inconsistent behavior: Empty link text is now also allowed for normal links, not just
    images (fixes [#305], reported by cabo)
  - The HTML5 `<mark>` element is now recognized as span level element (fixes [#298], reported by
    Niclas Darville)
  - Fixed problem where e-mail autolinks containing an underscore character were not correctly
    recognized (fixes [#293], reported by erikse)

* 3 other fixes:

  - Fixed missing package update statement for Travis (by Parker Moore)
  - Add some more documentation regarding MathJax (fixes [#296], pull request by Christopher
    Jefferson)
  - Fixed bad link in API documentation (fixes [#315], reported by Tom MacWright)
