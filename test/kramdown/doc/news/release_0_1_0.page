## kramdown 0.1.0 released

This is the first release of kramdown, yet-another-Markdown converter for Ruby, with the following
features:

* Written in pure Ruby, no need to compile an extension (like BlueCloth or rdiscount)

* Fast (current impl ~5x faster than Maruku, ~10x faster than BlueFeather, although ~30x slower than
  native code like rdiscount)

* Strict syntax definition (special cases for which the original Markdown page does not account for
  are explicitly listed and it is shown how kramdown parses them - see the [Syntax] page)

* Supports common Markdown extension (similar to Maruku)

[Syntax]: ../syntax.html
