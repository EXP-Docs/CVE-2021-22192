## kramdown 0.9.0 released

The biggest change in this release is the addition of a kramdown converter. This converter together
with the HTML parser enables one to convert an HTML document into a kramdown document.

Apart from that there are many other small changes and bug fixes, a full list of which you find
below.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  - New *kramdown converter* that converts an element tree into a kramdown document

* Minor changes:

  - Added option `numeric_entities` that defines whether entities are output using their names or
    their numeric values
  - Added option `toc_depth` for specifying how many header levels to include in the table of
    contents (patch by Alex Marandon)
  - Ruby 1.9 only: The HTML converter now always tries to convert entities to their character
    equivalences if possible
  - Change in HTML parser: conversion of `pre` and `code` elements to their native counterpart is
    only done if they contain no entities (under Ruby 1.9 entities are converted to characters
    before this check if possible)
  - The comment extension now produces comment elements that are used by the converters
  - IALs can now also be assigned to definitions (i.e. `dd` elements)
  - Image links may now be specified without alternative text (requested by Rune Myrland, fixes
    RF#28292)
  - The HTML parser gained the ability to convert conforming `span` and `div` elements to `math`
    elements
  - The LaTeX converter now outputs the element attributes as LaTeX comment for some elements
    (blockquotes, lists and math environments; requested by Michael Franzl)

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed problem with list item IALs: the IAL was not recognized when first element was a code
    block
  - Fixed ri documentation error on gem installation (patch by Alex Marandon)
  - Math content is now correctly escaped when using the HTML converter
  - Fixed html-to-native conversion of tables to only convert conforming tables

* Deprecation notes:

  - The `filter_html` option has been removed.
  - The method `Kramdown::Converter::Html#options_for_element` has been renamed to
    `html_attributes` -- using the old name is deprecated and the alias will be removed in the next
    release
