## kramdown 0.13.4 released

This is mostly a bug fix release and it is recommened to update to this version.

## Changes

* 1 minor change:

  - Added a converter that extracts the TOC of a document (requested by Brendan Hay). Note that this
    is only useful if you use kramdown as a library!

  - Fixed HTML converter to correctly output empty `span` tags (patch by John Croisant)
  - Fixed bug [RF#29350]: Parsing of HTML tags with mismatched case now works
  - Fixed bug [RF#29426]: Content of `style` tags is treated as raw text now
  - HTML converter now uses `rel` instead of `rev` to be HTML5 compatible (patch by Joe Fiorini)
  - Fixed Ruby 1.9.3 related warnings
  - Fixed HTML parser to work around an implementation change of Array#delete_if in Ruby 1.9.3
