## kramdown 1.4.0 released

This release fixes all outstanding bugs, so it is recommended to update. The one new feature is that
the location of the footnotes can now be defined by attaching the reference name "footnotes" to an
ordered or unordered list (like with the table of contents).

One major problem was that unescaped pipe characters `|` often led to involunatary tables. This
release introduces some changes that should prevent this for more cases than before. Additionally,
since this is the most common problem case, it is advised to use `\vert` instead of `|` in inline
math statements. Both do the same in LaTeX but the latter may inadvertently start a table, so better
use the former!


## Changes

* 2 minor changes:

  - Implemented [#106]: Users can now define the location of the footnotes (feature request by Matt
    Neuburg)
  - Merged [#97]: `rake gemspec` now generates a local `kramdown.gemspec` file (pull request by
    Nathanael Jones)

* 9 bug fixes:

  - Fixed [#128]: `<script>` tags are now removed from math statements when converting to HTML
    (reported by Trevor Wennblom)
  - Fixed [#129]: Internal state of custom string scanner class was corrupted due to backtracking
    which led to problems with location tracking (reported by Mark Harrison)
  - Fixed [#112]: The content of `<kbd>`, `<samp>` and `<var>` is now also treated as raw HTML
    (reported by Denis Defreyne)
  - Fixed [#114]: Added missing HTML entity names (reported by Tomer Cohen)
  - Fixed [#101]: Fixed exception on missing alignment information when parsing HTML tables to
    native kramdown elements (initial pull request by zonecheung)
  - Fixed [#117]: The GFM parser now needs a space after a hash so that the line is identified as an
    atx header (reported by Trevo Wennblom)
  - Fixed [#131]: Location tracking in nested list was incorrect (reported by Mark Harrison)
  - Fixed/Worked around [#23], [#46], [#107], [#134]: Parsing math blocks that contain pipe
    characters now works, adjusting inline math statements to use `\vert` instead of `|` resolves
    the other problems (reported by many)
  - Fixed [#135]: Escaped pipes in alternative text of image links were not correctly escaped
    (reported by Philipp Rudloff)
