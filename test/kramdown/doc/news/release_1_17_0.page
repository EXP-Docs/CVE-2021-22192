## kramdown 1.17.0 released

This release adds support for another server side [math engine][katex] based on KaTeX but with an
easier installation method. There are also various fixes, the most important one being a change in
the Setext and atx style header parsers to prevent performance and potential denial of service
problems.

Thanks to all the people working on making kramdown better!
