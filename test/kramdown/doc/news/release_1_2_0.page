## kramdown 1.2.0 released

Some people wanted to see Github Flavored Markdown features in kramdown for a long time and now the
waiting is over, thanks to the new GFM parser by Arne Brasseur.

Aside from this new feature some bugs were also fixed. One that may have affected many people was
the missing support for new stringex library versions.

## Changes

* 2 minor changes:

  - Added a parser for [Github Flavored Markdown](../parser/gfm.html) (resolves [GH#68] by Arne
    Brasseur who provided the initial implementation)
  - HTML attributes are now output for horizontal lines

* 5 bug fixes:

  - The correct encoding on the result string is now set even when the template option is used
  - Fixed [GH#72], [GH#74]: All ways to set a header ID now follow the same scheme which is
    compliant with HTML IDs (except that dots are not allowed) (reported and initial patch by Matti
    Schneider)
  - Fixed [GH#73]: The default HTML template now has a DOCTYPE and sets the encoding correctly
    (initial patch by Simon Lydell)
  - Fixed [GH#67]: URLs of link elements are now escaped in the LaTeX converter to avoid problems
    (patch by Henning Perl)
  - Fixed [GH#70]: Any version of the stringex library is now supported (reported by Simon Lydell)
