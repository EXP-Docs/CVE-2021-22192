## kramdown 1.16.0 released

This release brings, amongst other things, support for setting default options for the kramdown
binary via a configuration file, two new options ('typographic_symbols' and
'footnote_backlink_inline') and the new server-side math engine [SsKaTeX] which doesn't need the
whole NodeJS stack to work properly.

Please also note that the [MathjaxNode] math engine now relies on the `mathjax-node-cli` package
instead of the `mathjax-node` package to work correctly. Make sure you update your NodeJS
installation accordingly.

Thanks to all the contributors and supporters that made this release possible!


## Changes

* 8 minor change:

  - The `kramdown` binary now supports specifying default options via configuration file (fixes
    [#453] requested by Kyle Barbour)
  - New GFM quirk 'no_auto_typographic' for disabling typographic conversions (fixes [#459] via pull
    request [#462], both by Kirill Kolyshkin)
  - The [MathjaxNode] math engine now needs the package `mathjax-node-cli` to work.
  - New math engine [SsKaTeX] for server-side rendering via KaTeX (patch [#455] by Christian
    Cornelssen)
  - When using the [Rouge] syntax highlighter, the `formatter` option can now be a String (patch
    [#448] by Alpha Chen)
  - New option 'typographic_symbols' to control how typographic symbols are output by the HTML and
    LaTeX converters (fixes [#472] requested by Kyle Barbour)
  - New option 'footnote_backlink_inline' to allow placing the footnote backlink into the last,
    possibly nested paragraph or header instead of creating a new paragraph (fixes [#454] requested
    by Kyle Barbour)
  - The GFM parser now supports task lists (fixes [#172] and [#346], patch [#442] by Andrew)

* 4 bug fixes:

  - Line breaks in a special situation were not respected (fixes [#461], reported by Buo-Ren Lin)
  - Fix the [RemoveHtmlTags] converter to also process footnote content (patch [#458] by Maximilian
    Scherr)
  - Fix bug in paragraph parsing when the 'html_to_native' option is used (fixes [#466], reported by
    eddibravo)
  - Fix bug in kramdown converter when an image without a 'src' attribute is encountered (patch
    [#470] by Uwe Kubosch)
