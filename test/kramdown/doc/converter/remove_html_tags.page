# RemoveHtmlTags Converter

## Introduction

This converter modifies a kramdown element tree and conditionally removes all block and/or span HTML
elements, XML processing instructions and `style` as well as `script` tags from it. The resulting
element tree should in most cases only contain "native" kramdown elements and is therefore better
suited for converters that do not output HTML (like the [kramdown converter](kramdown.html) or the
[latex converter](latex.html)).

A sample usage may be the following to convert a full HTML document (i.e. one that includes the HTML
doctype, the HTML head section, ...) into a kramdown document:

    kramdown -i html -o remove_html_tags,kramdown my_document.html

## Options

The RemoveHtmlTags converter supports the following options:

{options: {items: [remove_block_html_tags, remove_span_html_tags]}}


{include_file: doc/links.markdown}
