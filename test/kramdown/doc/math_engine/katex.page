## Math Engine KaTeX

This math engine was built-in until kramdown 2.0 and since then is available through the
[`kramdown-math-katex` gem](https://github.com/kramdown/math-katex).

The engine uses [KaTeX] via the [katex rubygem][katex-gem] to convert TeX math formulas into KaTeX
HTML, using ExecJS under the hood. This eliminates the need for client-side math-rendering
Javascript. This engine is somewhat similar to the [SsKaTeX](sskatex.html) math engine, but easier
to use and suitable for kramdown input from untrusted users.

See <https://github.com/kramdown/math-katex> for the documentation.
