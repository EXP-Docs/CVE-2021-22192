## Math Engine Ritex

This math engine was built-in until kramdown 2.0 and since then is available through the
[`kramdown-math-ritex` gem](https://github.com/kramdown/math-ritex).

Ritex converts TeX math formulas into MathML and can be used together with the [HTML
converter](../converter/html.html).

See <https://github.com/kramdown/math-ritex> for documentation!
