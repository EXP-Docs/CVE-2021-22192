## Math Engine itex2MML

This math engine was built-in until kramdown 2.0 and since then is available through the
[`kramdown-math-itex2mml` gem](https://github.com/kramdown/math-itex2mml).

[itex2MML](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MML.html) converts TeX math formulas into
MathML and can be used together with the [HTML converter](../converter/html.html).

See <https://github.com/kramdown/math-itex2mml> for documentation!
