## Syntax Highlighting With Minted

[Minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) (LPPL/BSD licensed) is a LaTeX package that facilitates
expressive syntax highlighting using the Pygments library. This highlighter can be used with the
[LaTeX converter](../converter/latex.html).

To use Minted, set the option ['syntax_highlighter'](../options.html#option-syntax-highlighter) to
'minted'. Also make sure that you have the 'minted' LaTeX package installed!

The Minted syntax highlighter supports the following keys of the option
['syntax_highlighter_opts'](../options.html#option-syntax-highlighter-opts):

default_lang
: The default language that should be used when no language is set.

line_numbers
: Add line numbers

wrap
: Break long lines (needs at least version 2.0 of the 'minted' LaTeX package)
