## Syntax Highlighting With Coderay

This syntax highlighter was built-in until kramdown 2.0 and since then is available through the
[`kramdown-syntax-coderay` gem](https://github.com/kramdown/syntax-coderay).

[Coderay](http://coderay.rubychan.de) (MIT licensed) can be used as syntax highlighter for code
blocks and code spans when converting to HTML.

See <https://github.com/kramdown/syntax-coderay> for documentation!
